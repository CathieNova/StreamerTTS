# What is Streamer TTS?
It's a program that allows you to write text into it and have a voice speak that text for you, it was originally made for me personally but i have adjusted it to fit a public release, i have seen a lot of "mute" people streaming and communicating to others using Text.
With this program you can easily communicate with your Stream Chat or friends in Discord, and other things like games.
